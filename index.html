          <p class="lead" style="margin:0;">
            To serve the wider MENA region, we established our UAE-registered sister company, UNIFIED, in 2023.
            Although UNEPP and UNIFIED are independently registered entities, they share the same group of shareholders
            and operate in close coordination — providing integrated engineering, procurement, and project management
            services across the full project lifecycle.
