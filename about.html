      <h2>Company Overview</h2>

      <p class="lead">
        United Engineers for Petroleum Projects (UNEPP) is an independently registered company,
        established in Egypt in 2008. We deliver comprehensive technical services across all phases
        of oil and gas development — from concept to commissioning — built on a strong foundation
        of engineering excellence and reliable project execution.
      </p>

      <p>
        To extend our regional presence across the MENA region, our UAE-registered sister company,
        Unified Engineering Consultancy Limited (UNIFIED), was independently established in 2023.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although UNEPP and UNIFIED are independently registered entities, they share the same group
        of shareholders and operate in close coordination. Together, they provide integrated engineering,
        procurement, and project management services across the full project lifecycle — including
        feasibility studies, concept selection, basic and detailed design, procurement support,
        construction supervision, commissioning, and operational support.
      </p>

      <p>
        UNEPP has been officially registered with the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS)
        since February 2009 under Registration No. 1258, and with the Egyptian General Petroleum
        Corporation (EGPC) since December 2010 under Registration No. 68.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both UNEPP and UNIFIED are certified to ISO 9001 (Quality Management), ISO 14001 (Environmental
        Management), and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety), demonstrating our commitment to
        delivering services that meet the highest international standards of quality, safety, and
        environmental responsibility.
